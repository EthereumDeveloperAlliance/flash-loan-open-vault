## Deploy

The smart contracts can be deployed using a number of different methods. To continue to interact with the deployed smart contracts we recommend using the OpenZeppelin CLI

Setup the project using the OpenZeppelin CLI to easily interact with deployed contracts directly from the CLI.

### Open Zeppelin

```.sh
$ oz init
$ oz deploy
```

### Truffle

```.sh
$ truffle compile
$ truffle deploy --network [NETWORK]
```

## Send Transactions

If the contracts are deployed using the OpenZeppelin CLI you can continue to interact with contracts using several CLI commands.

```
$ oz call
$ oz send-tx
```
